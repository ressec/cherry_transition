## Purpose

This task aims to cover the design and implementation of the `[ENTITY]` persistence service.

It is composed of two parts, its **interface**, and its **implementation**.

That exposes the following services:

- [ ] `count` service
- [ ] `save` service
- [ ] `saveAndFlush` service
- [ ] `deleteById` service
- [ ] `findAll` service
- [ ] `findByStatus` service
- [ ] `findByOwnerId` service
- [ ] `search` service

## [ENTITY]ServiceCore implementation

That implements the following services:

- [ ] `count` service
- [ ] `save` service
- [ ] `saveAndFlush` service
- [ ] `deleteById` service
- [ ] `findAll` service
- [ ] `findByStatus` service
- [ ] `findByOwnerId` service
- [ ] `search` service
